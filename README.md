# Boop

**Boop** is the glorified calculator for all your not so mathematical needs. You
can either use its REPL, or add it to your own project as a library.

## Installation

To use **Boop**, you'll first need to clone this repository and then build it
with **Cargo**, nothing fancy here:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/leonskidev/boop
$ cargo build --release
```

You can find the compiled executable in `../boop/target/release/`.
